## About The Project

SonGuess is an open-source project that's all about guessing songs. Players listen to song snippets and guess the right title.

Players can create their own sets of songs, tailored to their favorite artists, genres, or personal preferences. The game integrates with Spotify, allowing users to import their playlists and immerse themselves in their own music while playing along.

The future of the project holds the promise of a multiplayer mode, where you can challenge your friends and compete in real-time song guessing battles.
